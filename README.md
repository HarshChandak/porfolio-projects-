# Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning & Decision Intelligence

## Predictive Modeling & Risk Classification
- Designed and deployed **machine learning classification models** using ensemble techniques (Random Forest, Bagging) to predict high-risk outcomes from structured datasets.
- Optimized for **precision, robustness, and interpretability**, enabling confident, data-driven decision-making in uncertainty-heavy environments.
- Executed **feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation** to improve generalization and reliability.

## Unsupervised Learning & Segmentation Systems
- Built **unsupervised learning frameworks** to segment entities based on quantitative attributes and performance indicators.
- Enabled **pattern discovery, comparative analysis, and strategic grouping** to support prioritization, targeting, and optimization initiatives.
- Applied clustering techniques to convert raw metrics into **actionable insights**.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & Knowledge Systems
- Architected a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for navigating complex, document-heavy knowledge domains.
- Delivered **evidence-grounded AI responses** with strict hallucination controls, improving trust, accuracy, and explainability.
- Designed for adaptability across **policy, compliance, operations, and enterprise knowledge management** use cases.
